# Genetic-ANFIS-Classification
- Genetic Fuzzy and Genetic ANFIS Classification
- Okay, what about combining evolutionary algorithms with fuzzy logic and ANFIS for classification? Well, letâ€™s push some limits!!! Data is consisted of 50 samples with 5 features and 5 classes. You can put your data in the system and run it. You have to play with parameters depending on your data and system. Right now, you can just run the code and see the result. You have to wait for Genetic Algorithm to finish training.
- Enjoy the code and feel free to ask your question from me:
