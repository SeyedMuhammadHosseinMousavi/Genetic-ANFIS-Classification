- Genetic Fuzzy and Genetic ANFIS Classification

<div align="justify">

- Okay, what about combining evolutionary algorithms with fuzzy logic and ANFIS for classification? Well, letâ€™s push some limits!!! Data is consisted of 50 samples with 5 features and 5 classes. You can put your data in the system and run it. You have to play with parameters depending on your data and system. Right now, you can just run the code and see the result. You have to wait for Genetic Algorithm to finish training.

- Enjoy the code and feel free to ask your question from me:

# Genetic ANFIS Classification with Fuzzy Logic

This repository provides a MATLAB implementation of a Genetic Adaptive Neuro-Fuzzy Inference System (ANFIS) for classification tasks. The system leverages Fuzzy Logic, Genetic Algorithms (GA), and ANFIS to classify data effectively, demonstrating enhanced accuracy through evolutionary optimization techniques.

## Features

- **Fuzzy Logic System Creation**: Automatic generation of a fuzzy inference system (FIS) using clustering techniques.
- **ANFIS Training**: Training a FIS using the ANFIS algorithm to optimize fuzzy rules and parameters.
- **Genetic Algorithm Integration**: Using Genetic Algorithms to fine-tune the FIS and ANFIS parameters.
- **Visualization Tools**: Plotting results, membership functions, and performance metrics for analysis.
- **Performance Metrics**: Includes RMSE, MSE, and confusion matrix for model evaluation.
