%% Genetic Fuzzy and Genetic ANFIS Classification
% Okay, what about combining evolutionary algorithms with fuzzy logic and
% ANFIS for classification? Well, letâ€™s push some limits!!! Data is
% consisted of 50 samples with 5 features and 5 classes. You can put your
% data in the system and run it. You have to play with parameters depending
% on your data and system. Right now, you can just run the code and see the
% result. You have to wait for Genetic Algorithm to finish training. 
% This code is part of the following project. So, please cite them after use:
